            <p>
              Once upon a time there was a girl named Suep who got lost in the woods.
She desperately tried to go back home to her Soppu collection, as the plushie that she caringly kept on her bed would have felt very lonely without her.
But she was lost. So she tried to find someone that could direct her towards a path that could lead her out of the dark woods.
She first found a Kittysop.</br>
He was wary and fearful and hid behind a rock in fright.</br>
His silver fur stood on ends and he could only utter</br>
<i>“Mreow! I am very sorry but I do not know the way to the exit! I can’t help! You have to find someone else!”</i></br>
And so the little Suep ventured further into the woods to find someone who could help her.</br>
She walked and walked underneath the canopy of trees that shielded any ray of sunlight and, eventually, she encountered a little creature; soft and with kid eyes.
She asked again, in hope to find her way back home.</br>
But the little Bunnysop could only shake his head.</br>
<i>“I am sorry, miss. I am new to this area and I don't know my way around! But if you go further down there should be someone who knows the directions!”</i></br>
And once more, the little Suep wandered deeper in the forest, on the lookout for anyone who could help her.</br>
It took her some time before she finally found someone. A lazy one, this was. The Catsop dangled his limbs from a branch, idly pawing at some leaves. Purring with not a care in the world, the creature stretched, taking his time to answer</br>
<i>“I may know or I may not know, but I would advise to look for someone more reliable for directions”.</i></br>
And so he turned away and went back to sleep.</br>
Huffing and stomping away, the little Suep looked for a more helpful soul that could guide her out of the forest.</br>
It was not long until she found a new helper. At her introduction, the little being was shocked, frantically trying to find a way to convey the message, his little floppy ears twitching in trepidation.</br>
<i>“Miss Suep! Miss Suep! The King has been waiting for you! Follow me, please! He requested an audience with you!”</i></br>
And so he guided her, down down down further into the woods.</br>
The little Suep diligently followed, a little preoccupied that she would not make it in time to get back home to her Soppu collection.</br>
But eventually The little Bunnysop led her to a clearing within the thick forest.</br>
The little bunny then curtsied, leaving her to speak with the King himself.</br>
<i>“I am the Bnuy King, Miss Suep. I have been waiting for you for quite some time now and I know of all the endeavors you went through to find your way back home. I will personally guide you back, but before that. I shall grant you a reward for the long journey you went through”.</i></br>
The Bnuy King then handed her a box. It looked old and a bit worse for wear, but it showed how precious the content was. He took her hand and guided her back to her home, where all the Soppus were waiting for her.</br>
As soon as the Soppus saw her, they gleed happily, finally reuniting with Suep.
